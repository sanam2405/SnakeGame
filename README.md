# SnakeGame
This is a clone of the much popular Snake Game. The game stars with a snake that can move in four directions and an apple that the snake can eat. Initally the snake has a predefined size. Whenever the snake eats an apple, it grows in size by one unit and another apple appears at some other random position in the screen. The game continues until the Snake hits itself or hits any of the four boundaries of the screen.
